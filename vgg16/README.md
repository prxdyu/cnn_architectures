# VGG16 Implementation using PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of the VGG16 architecture using PyTorch. VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model that is widely used for various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## Introduction

VGG16 is a variant of the VGG architecture introduced by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman in their paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition". It consists of 16 layers and is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition tasks. This implementation provides a modular and flexible way to build VGG16 networks for various computer vision tasks.

## Features

- **Flexible Usage**: Users can create VGG16 models with different numbers of input channels and classes, making it versatile for different tasks and datasets.

## Usage

To use the VGG16 implementation in your project, follow these steps:

- Install the required dependencies, including PyTorch.
- Import the VGG16 class from the provided code.
- Instantiate the VGG16 model with appropriate parameters:
  - **in_channels**: number of input channels
    - 1 if the input images are in grayscale
    - 3 if input images are colored
  - **num_classes**: the number of classes in your classification task.
- Train the model on your dataset and evaluate its performance.

### Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from vgg import VGG16  # Assuming the code is in a file named vgg.py

# Define the number of input channels and classes
in_channels = 3
num_classes = 1000

# Instantiate the VGG16 model
model = VGG16(in_channels=in_channels, num_classes=num_classes)

# Define a transform to preprocess the images
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

# Load your dataset
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):  # number of epochs
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        # Zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # Backward pass and optimization
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/10], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'vgg16.pth')

# To evaluate the model, load it and run inference on your test dataset
# Add your evaluation code here...
